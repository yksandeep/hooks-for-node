# Welcome to the React-Style Hooks for Node.js!

Congratulations! You've stumbled upon a glorious piece of code that lets you use React-like hooks in your Node.js applications. Yes, you heard it right! Now you can enjoy the thrill of managing state and effects without the overhead of a browser. Who needs a UI anyway? Let‚Äôs dive into the whimsical world of hooks.js!

### Why Use This?

Because Why Not?: If you've ever wanted to manage state in a Node.js environment like you do in React, then this is your golden ticket. Who cares if it‚Äôs overkill? It‚Äôs fun!
For the Love of Sarcasm: You can now tell your friends you‚Äôre using hooks in Node.js. Just imagine their faces when they realize it‚Äôs not React!

## Getting Started

 - Clone This Repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yksandeep/hooks-for-node.git
    cd hooks-for-node
    ```
 - Install Dependencies:

    No dependencies required! Just pure JavaScript..
 - Use It:

    Simply import the hooks and start writing your code like you're building a React app. Because who needs a front-end anyway?
    ```javascript
    const { useState, useEffect, createContext, useContext } = require('./hooks');
    ```

## How to Use

#### State Management
You can manage state just like in React!

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
setCount(prev => prev + 1);
```

#### Effects
Want to run side effects? Go ahead! It‚Äôs just like magic‚Äîif magic involved a lot of debugging.
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Count changed!", count.value);
}, [count]);
```

#### Context API

Because who doesn‚Äôt love passing props through layers of components? Oh wait...
```javascript
const SomeContext = createContext({ count, setCount });
const value = useContext(SomeContext);
```

## Example Usage
Check out our delightful examples:

- Task Manager CLI: Because managing tasks in a command line is what every developer dreams about.
- Context Example: A perfect demonstration of how to confuse your friends with context usage in Node.js.

## Limitations
- No UI: Remember, this is for Node.js. So, if you were hoping for a shiny interface, you might want to reconsider your life choices.
- <b>Debugging Fun</b>: Expect to have a blast debugging because nothing says ‚Äúfun‚Äù like trying to figure out why your effect didn‚Äôt trigger.


## Conclusion
So there you have it! A delightful way to bring React-style hooks into your Node.js applications. Whether you're building a CLI tool or just want to feel fancy while managing state, this is the way to go! Now go forth and spread the word! Let everyone know that you can use React patterns in Node.js because who doesn't want to add unnecessary complexity to their life? Happy coding! üéâ
