# Conway's Game of Life in Node.js

Welcome to **Conway's Game of Life**, where we decided that React patterns belong in Node.js because, why not? Who needs a front-end framework when you can have all the complexity of state management in a terminal application? 

## About the Project

In this highly sophisticated terminal application, we've implemented Conway's Game of Life using the same patterns that developers use in React. Yes, you heard that right—`useState` and `useEffect` in Node.js! Because who doesn't want to mix their back-end logic with front-end flair? If you ever wondered, "How can I make my terminal game more confusing?"—look no further!

### Features

- A grid filled with random alive (1) and dead (0) cells, because randomness is fun!
- The classic Game of Life rules, but in a terminal. It’s like a beautiful mess of ones and zeros.
- User input to start, stop, or exit the game—what a groundbreaking feature!

## Usage

Upon running the game, you will be greeted with an impressive grid of cells. Use your keyboard like it's 1999 and input the commands listed below. Enjoy the thrill of watching cells live and die while you desperately try to figure out if you're actually doing anything productive.

## Commands

- `exit`: Exits the game. Because at some point, you’ll want to stop pretending to be entertained by a grid of cells.
- `stop`: Pauses the game, allowing you to reflect on your life choices.
- `start`: Resumes the game. Because nothing says "I have my life together" like toggling a terminal game on and off.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute, but remember: you're entering a realm where React patterns invade Node.js. It's a wild ride, so buckle up!

### Final Thoughts

Congratulations! You've successfully run Conway's Game of Life in a terminal using React patterns. The next time someone asks you about using React hooks in Node.js, you can confidently say, "Done that" Enjoy your newfound ability to create terminal applications that are as complex as they are absurd!
